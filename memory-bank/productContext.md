## Product Context

This project aims to create a TypeScript-based SDK that captures screenshots during test execution.

### Purpose
The SDK will serve as the first step toward building a SaaS platform for test analysis and feedback, branded as Testiv.ai.

### Problems Solved
- Provides a simple way to capture screenshots during test execution.
- Enables easier integration into existing test projects.
- Lays the foundation for future test analysis and feedback features.

### How it Should Work
The SDK should capture screenshots when test events occur (e.g., clicks, failures). It should be easy to integrate into existing Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, and Puppeteer test projects.

### User Experience Goals
- Simple and intuitive API.
- Easy to configure and integrate.
- Minimal impact on test execution time.
